# Data Science Projects

## [**Metagenome Environment Classification**](https://github.com/sophieyeh256/W207_Final_Project)
### _Decision Tree, XGB, Neural Net, SHAP, Biotech_
Anywhere there is life, there is bacteria. Microbiologists have sequenced metagenome samples to assemble 
sets of protein families plus the environment classificaiton from which the sample was collected. 
This project aims to create an environment classifier for protein samples and analyze the feature 
importance within our final models.


## [**A Descriptive Analysis of Climate Change Accountability**](https://github.com/sophieyeh256/w200_project2_bluhm_kim_Yeh)
### _Data Visualization, Matplotlib, Plotly, Climate_
One major debate at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference is whether the world's wealthiest nations are the most responsible 
for global warming and whether they should compensate poorer nations for increasingly severe weather. Thus, this project aims 
to visualize and compare the severe weather experience between high- and low-polluters in the world.


## [**ACME Delivery Analytics**](https://github.com/sophieyeh256/DataEng_SQL/blob/main/ucb_mids_w205_project_3/Acme%20Delivery%20Strategy.pdf)
### _SQL, Neo4J, Data Engineering, Sales Analytics, Data Visualization_
ACME, a lunch delivery business, is looking into opening more locations in the Bay Area and investing in robots and/or drones in the future. 
Customer data, sales data, and store data were queried using SQL and Neo4J then analyzed to assess business considerations.


## [**FIFA Player Market Value Factors**](https://github.com/sophieyeh256/ucb_mids_w203_lab2)
### _R, Linear Regression, Feature Selection, Hypothesis Testing, Large Sample Assumptions, sports_
FIFA is a professional organization that recruits athletes based on a variety of factors recorded in their databasis. 
Our research question is how does a goal keeper's performance, background, and physical attributes affect their market value in football (soccer)?
The aim is to focus hypothesis testing, large sample assumptions, and statistical concepts such as Independent and Identical Distribution, covariation, collinearity, p-values, VIF, and diagnostic plots.  


## [**Did Democratic or Republican voters experience more difficulty voting during the 2020 election?**](https://github.com/sophieyeh256/ucb_mids_w203_lab1)
### _R, Wilcoxon Ranked Sum Test, Hypothesis Testing, politics_
Our analysis takes a detailed look at the dataset from 2020 American National Election Studies by categorizing respondents to appropriate political parties and applying the Wilcoxon Ranked Sum Test to evaluate the null hypothesis that Democratic and Republican voters had equal
difficulty voting in 2020 elections.  


## [**Gym Routine App**](w200_project1_gymroutine)
### _Python, SQLite Tkinter, Web Scraping, Inventory Management, Gym_
Gym fitness is one of the most efficient ways of building muscle but to achieve a proportional body shape, gym-goers plan a routine
that encompasses a variety of muscles. This project uses Spyder to obtain information from a exercise encyclopedia on workouts and
relevant muscle groups. The app interface allows users to plan their routine and view the muscle distribution of their workouts. 
A recommendation function suggests exercises that will even out the muscle distribution of their current workout plan and a sqLite
database is used to store workout exercise information and user routines.

## [**Citadel Terminal Summer 2022 Invitational Competition**](https://github.com/sophieyeh256/terminal-summer22-eiren)
### _Python, Algorithms, Gaming, Team Eiren_
In this competition, teams have one week to develop an algorithm in Python to compete with others in Tower Defense.
